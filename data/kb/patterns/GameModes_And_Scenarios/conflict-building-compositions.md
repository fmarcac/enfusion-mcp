# Conflict Building & Composition System

Players can build fortifications, relay radios, FOBs, and support structures at bases using supplies. This system uses a budget-based placement model with a master provider pattern.

---

## Architecture

```
SCR_CampaignBuildingProviderComponent  (on a base entity or vehicle)
    ↓ checks budgets (CAMPAIGN=supplies, PROPS, AI)
    ↓ reads SCR_ResourceComponent for supply balance
SCR_CampaignBuildingCompositionComponent  (on each placed composition)
    ↓ tracks cost, builder, provider, lock state
SCR_CompositionSlotManagerComponent  (on GameMode)
    ↓ manages slot occupancy
```

---

## Building Provider (`SCR_CampaignBuildingProviderComponent`)

Attached to the entity that offers the build interface (usually the main base entity or a service truck).

### Key properties
| Property | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `m_fBuildingRadius` | `50` | Radius in which compositions can be placed |
| `m_iRank` | `1` | Minimum rank to use (1 = Private) |
| `m_bIsMasterProvider` |  -  | HQ entity: owns the shared supply budget |
| `m_bUseMasterProvider` |  -  | Defer to master provider for budget |
| `m_bUseAllAvailableProviders` |  -  | Aggregate all nearby providers |
| `m_bRegisterAtBase` |  -  | Auto-register with nearest base on spawn |
| `m_bObstructViewWhenEnemyInRange` |  -  | Block building UI when enemy detected |
| `m_bAnyFactionCanUse` |  -  | Allow all factions to build (e.g. neutral zones) |

### Budget system
Three independent budgets are evaluated before any composition can be placed:

| Budget type | `EEditableEntityBudget` | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `CAMPAIGN` | Supplies budget | Deducted from base supply pool |
| `PROPS` | Static object budget | World object count limit |
| `AI` | AI entity budget | Limits total spawned AI |

Check order: `IsThereEnoughBudgetToSpawn(array<ref SCR_EntityBudgetValue> budgetCosts)`  -  all three must pass.

Master provider pattern: Only the HQ/MOB base is typically the master provider. All other providers at the same base use `m_bUseMasterProvider = true` to draw from the same supply pool.

```c
// Check if there are enough supplies before building
bool ok = provider.IsThereEnoughSupplies(
    availableSupplies,   // current supplies at base
    supplyCost,          // cost of this composition
    accumulatedCost      // supplies already committed this tick
);
```

## Placed Composition (`SCR_CampaignBuildingCompositionComponent`)

Attached to every placed/built entity.

### Key properties
| Property | Description |
|---|---|
| `m_bCompositionIsSpawned` (RplProp) | True when fully spawned and usable |
| `m_iBuilderId` | Player ID of builder (0 = INVALID_PLAYER_ID) |
| `m_iCost` | Supply cost (read from EditableEntity budget at spawn) |
| `m_iPrefabId` | Composition type ID for building mode |
| `m_bInteractionLock` (RplSaved) | Prevents move/delete in Free Roam mode |
| `m_ProviderEntity` | The base/provider this composition belongs to |

### Key methods
```c
IsCompositionSpawned() → bool
GetCompositionCost() → int          // supply cost
GetBuilderId() → int                // player who built it
SetBuilderId(int id)
IsInteractionLocked() → bool
SetInteractionLock(bool lockState)  // broadcast via RPC
SetProviderEntity(IEntity base)
RemoveProviderEntity()
GetOnCompositionSpawned() → ScriptInvokerBool
GetOnBuilderSet() → ScriptInvokerVoid
```

### Service state during construction
While building: sets the service point to `UNDER_CONSTRUCTION` state. UI shows progress indicator. When `m_bCompositionIsSpawned` flips to true, service becomes active.

## Buildable Compositions

Compositions are categorized by slot type. Costs are in supplies (CAMPAIGN budget).

### Slot types
| Slot | Size | Typical compositions |
|---|---|---|
| `SlotFlatSmall` | Small flat | Sandbags, hedgehogs, barbed tape |
| `SlotFlatMedium` | Medium flat | MG nest, bunker small, camo net |
| `SlotFlatLarge` | Large flat | Bunker large, living area |
| `SlotRoadSmall` | Small roadside | Roadblock, barricade small |
| `SlotRoadMedium` | Medium roadside | Checkpoint, barricade medium |
| `SlotRoadLarge` | Large roadside | Gate, large checkpoint |

### Common compositions and costs
| Composition | Supply cost | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Barbed Tape | 20 | Perimeter obstacle |
| Czech Hedgehog | 20 | Anti-vehicle obstacle |
| Dragonsteeth | 20 | Anti-vehicle |
| Sandbag Round | 20 | Infantry cover |
| Sandbag Long | 30 | Infantry cover |
| Sandbag Solid | 30 | Thicker cover |
| Camo Net Small | 30 | Vehicle concealment |
| Camo Net Medium | 40 | Larger concealment |
| Machine Gun Nest | varies | Defensive position |
| Bunker Small | varies | Infantry shelter |
| Vehicle Maintenance | 100 | Service point for vehicles |
| Barricade Medium | 100 | Road blocking |
| Field Hospital | varies | Medical service |
| Ammo Storage | varies | Ammo resupply |
| Fuel Storage | varies | Fuel resupply |

## Relay Radio (`ConflictRelayRadio.et`)

The relay radio is the most strategically important buildable. It extends radio coverage and grants +4 supplies/tick to connected bases.

**Prefab GUID:** `{522DCD528AE27052}Prefabs/Systems/MilitaryBase/ConflictRelayRadio.et`

### Structure
```
GenericEntity ID "5C727AD73024FB47"
 SCR_CampaignMilitaryBaseComponent {
  m_iRadius = 10
  m_bShowNotifications = 0
  m_sBaseName = "#AR-MapIcon_Tower"
  m_eType = RELAY
 }
 SCR_CoverageRadioComponent {
  Turned on = 0           // disabled at spawn  -  requires reconfiguration
  Transceivers {
   RelayTransceiver {
    Transmitting Range = 3000    // 3km coverage radius
    Frequency resolution = 1
   }
  }
 }
 SCR_FactionAffiliationComponent { faction affiliation = "FIA" }
```

### Reconfiguration
The relay radio is **disabled at spawn** (`Turned on = 0`). A player must perform a 10-second `CampaignReconfigureRelay` action to activate it.

```
Child: RadioStation_R123M_01.et
 SCR_CampaignReconfigureRelayUserAction { Duration = 10s }
```

### Relay radio vs pre-placed radio
- `ConflictRelayRadio.et`  -  player-buildable, starts disabled, 3000m range
- Pre-placed relay in `Bases.layer`  -  permanent, enabled, typically 1470m range
- Pre-placed relay tower positions: use `SCR_CampaignRelayAlternativeSpot` entities  -  randomized placement candidates

---

## Composition Slot Manager (`SCR_CompositionSlotManagerComponent`)

Attached to GameMode entity. Tracks which composition slots are occupied.

```c
// Get instance
SCR_CompositionSlotManagerComponent mgr =
    SCR_CompositionSlotManagerComponent.GetInstance();

// Check if slot is occupied
bool occupied = mgr.IsOccupied(slotEntity);

// Get what's in a slot
IEntity occupant = mgr.GetOccupant(slotEntity);

// Set occupant (server-side, broadcasts)
mgr.SetOccupant(slotEntity, compositionEntity);

// Find slot by position
mgr.SetOccupant(worldPos, compositionEntity);

// Events
mgr.GetOnEntityChanged(); // fires when any slot changes
```

---

## Budget Validation Flow

When a player tries to place a composition:

1. `IsThereEnoughBudgetToSpawn(budgetCosts)` checks all budget types
2. For CAMPAIGN budget: `IsThereEnoughSupplies(available, cost, accumulated)`
3. For PROPS budget: checks static object count against world limit
4. For AI budget: checks spawned AI count against `SCR_AIWorld.GetAILimit()`
5. All must pass  -  if any fails, placement is blocked with UI feedback

Deferred budget changes (avoid double-spending during same frame):
```c
provider.AccumulateBudgetChange(EEditableEntityBudget.CAMPAIGN, cost);
int pending = provider.GetAccumulatedBudgetChanges(EEditableEntityBudget.CAMPAIGN);
provider.ClearAccumulatedBudgetChanges();
```

---

## Scenario Design Notes

- **Relay radios are win conditions**  -  a faction that builds relay chains extends spawn coverage and gains supply income. Design maps with radio range gaps to incentivize building.
- **Fortification slots** define what can be built at a base. Production mods place `SlotFlat*` and `SlotRoad*` entities inside `BaseLogic.layer` compositions.
- **Master provider at MOB**  -  always set the MOB as `m_bIsMasterProvider`. All other service providers at the same base should use `m_bUseMasterProvider`.
- **Building radius**  -  default 50m. Increase for large airfield/harbour bases.
- **Rank gate**  -  `m_iRank 3` (Sergeant) is common for expensive compositions. Prevents new players from wasting supplies.
