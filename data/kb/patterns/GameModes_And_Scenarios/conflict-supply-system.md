# Conflict Supply System

The supply system is the economic backbone of all Conflict scenarios. Supplies fund building, spawning, and base establishment. Understanding the flow is essential for designing balanced scenarios.

---

## Architecture

The modern supply system uses `SCR_ResourceComponent` internally. The older `SCR_CampaignSuppliesComponent` still exists on vehicles and depots but is marked `[Obsolete]`  -  do not use it for new logic. Query supply values through `SCR_CampaignMilitaryBaseComponent` and the gamemode getters.

## Supply Income Flow

```
Harbor / Airfield (source base)
    → every 300s: +2500 supplies distributed to connected friendly bases

HQ / MOB
    → every 5s: +40 supplies (m_iRegularSuppliesIncome)
    → each connected relay radio: +4 extra/tick

Regular contested base
    → every 5s: +4 supplies (m_iRegularSuppliesIncomeBase)
    → each connected relay radio: +4 extra/tick

Quick replenish (when below threshold)
    → income × 2.0 multiplier (m_fQuickSuppliesReplenishMultiplier)
    → threshold: 200 supplies (m_iQuickSuppliesReplenishThreshold)

Auto-replenish ceiling: 1000 supplies (m_iSuppliesReplenishThreshold)
    → income only flows up to this cap
```

## Gamemode Supply Attributes (`SCR_GameModeCampaign`)

### Income
| Attribute | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `m_iRegularSuppliesIncome` | `40` | HQ/MOB income per tick |
| `m_iRegularSuppliesIncomeBase` | `4` | Regular base income per tick |
| `m_iRegularSuppliesIncomeExtra` | `4` | Bonus per connected relay radio per tick |
| `m_iRegularSuppliesIncomeSource` | `2500` | Source base (harbor/airfield) income per distribution |
| `m_iSuppliesArrivalInterval` | `5` | Seconds between base income ticks |
| `m_iSuppliesArrivalIntervalSource` | `300` | Seconds between source base distributions |

### Thresholds
| Attribute | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `m_iSuppliesReplenishThreshold` | `1000` | Auto-replenish ceiling  -  income stops above this |
| `m_iQuickSuppliesReplenishThreshold` | `200` | Below this: income ×2.0 |
| `m_fQuickSuppliesReplenishMultiplier` | `2.0` | Multiplier when below quick threshold |

### Starting Supplies
| Attribute | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `m_iHQStartingSupplies` | `600` | Initial supplies for HQ/MOB bases |
| `m_iMinStartingSupplies` | `100` | Randomized start min for regular bases |
| `m_iMaxStartingSupplies` | `500` | Randomized start max for regular bases |
| `m_iStartingSuppliesInterval` | `25` | Randomization step size |
| `m_bRandomizeSupplies` | `true` | Toggle randomized starting supplies |

**Note:** Production mods typically set `m_iSupplies 500` on MOB entities (not 3000). The `3000` max cap is just the ceiling, not the starting amount.

### Map Display
| Attribute | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `m_iSupplyDepotIconThreshold` | `1200` | Distance to show standalone depots on map |

---

## Per-Base Supply Overrides (`SCR_CampaignMilitaryBaseComponent`)

These override the gamemode defaults for individual bases:

| Property | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `m_iRegularSuppliesIncomeBase` | `-1` | Per-base income override (-1 = use gamemode value) |
| `m_iSuppliesArrivalInterval` | `-1` | Per-base tick interval override (-1 = use gamemode) |
| `m_fSupplyLimit` | `0.2` | Resupply threshold as fraction of max capacity (0-0.9) |
| `m_fReservedSupplyAmount` | `0.5` | Fraction kept in reserve for storage (0.1-0.9) |
| `m_eSupplyRequestExecutionPriority` | `MEDIUM` | Priority when multiple resupply tasks compete |

---

## Rank-Based Supply Allocation

Players receive a personal supply budget based on rank (from `CampaignMilitarySupplyAllocationConfig.conf`). Replenishment interval: 300s.

| Rank | Allocation |
|---|---|
| Renegade | 0 |
| Private | 65 |
| Corporal | 100 |
| Sergeant | 135 |
| Lieutenant | 185 |
| Captain | 235 |
| Major | 300 |

Mod override (SeizeAMPSecure values):

| Rank | Allocation |
|---|---|
| Private | 50 |
| Corporal | 75 |
| Sergeant | 100 |
| Lieutenant | 150 |
| Captain | 250 |
| Major | 400 |

---

## Supply Vehicle System (`SCR_CampaignSuppliesComponent`)

Supply trucks and helicopters carry supplies between depots and bases.

Key properties (on vehicle entity):
- `m_iSupplies` (RplProp)  -  current supply amount on vehicle
- `m_iSuppliesMax` (RplProp)  -  vehicle capacity
- `m_fOperationalRadius`  -  load/unload radius (default 25m)
- `m_bIsStandaloneDepot`  -  marks standalone supply depot

Key methods:
```c
GetSupplies() → int
GetSuppliesMax() → int
AddSupplies(int supplies, bool replicate)
SetLastLoadedAt(SCR_CampaignMilitaryBaseComponent base)
SetLastUnloadedAt(SCR_CampaignMilitaryBaseComponent base)
AwardXP() → bool  // should XP be awarded for this unload?
static GetSuppliesComponent(IEntity ent) → searches entity + all slots
```

`SUPPLY_TRUCK_UNLOAD_RADIUS = 25m`  -  max distance from depot to load/unload.

XP: `m_fSupplyOffloadAssistanceReward 0.5`  -  XP multiplier for unloading supplies you didn't load yourself.

---

## Supply Sources (Harbors & Airfields)

Source bases use `SCR_CampaignSourceBaseComponent` (not `SCR_CampaignMilitaryBaseComponent`). They distribute `m_iRegularSuppliesIncomeSource` every `m_iSuppliesArrivalIntervalSource` seconds to connected friendly bases.

```
$grp GenericEntity : "{0226331FB6A8249A}Prefabs/Systems/MilitaryBase/ConflictSourceBase_T3Harbor.et" {
 HarborNorth {
  components {
   SCR_CampaignSourceBaseComponent "{621EB97024DABD3C}" {
    m_bExcludeFromRandomization 1
   }
  }
  coords 5803 2 3533
 }
}
```

Prefab tiers:
- `{8BEE4B0606893CDF}` `ConflictSourceBase_T1Harbor.et`  -  small
- `{0226331FB6A8249A}` `ConflictSourceBase_T3Harbor.et`  -  large
- `{1739B43A3702BB84}` `ConflictSourceBase_Airfield.et`  -  airfield

---

## Supply Script API

### Querying base supplies
```c
SCR_CampaignMilitaryBaseComponent base = ...;

// Get current supply scarcity (positive = needs resupply)
float scarcity = base.GetScarcityLevel();

// Is resupply needed?
bool needed = base.IsResupplyNeeded();

// Events
base.GetOnSuppliesArrivalInvoker(); // ScriptInvokerVoid  -  fires each income tick
base.GetOnSupplyLimitChanged();
base.GetOnReservedSupplyAmountChanged();
```

### Querying gamemode supply settings
```c
SCR_GameModeCampaign gm = SCR_GameModeCampaign.Cast(GetGame().GetGameMode());
int hqIncome  = gm.GetRegularSuppliesIncome();        // 40 default
int baseIncome = gm.GetRegularSuppliesIncomeBase();    // 4 default
int relayBonus = gm.GetRegularSuppliesIncomeExtra();   // 4 per relay
int sourceIncome = gm.GetRegularSuppliesIncomeSource(); // 2500 default
int replenishCap = gm.GetSuppliesReplenishThreshold();  // 1000 default
```

---

## Supply Distribution Override (ConflictEscalation pattern)

Even distribution of harbor supplies across owned bases:

```c
modded class SCR_GameModeCampaign
{
    [Attribute("0", UIWidgets.CheckBox, "Distribute harbor supplies evenly")]
    protected bool m_bSupplyHarborDistributionEnabled;

    [Attribute("50", UIWidgets.EditBox, "Supplies per harbor distribution tick")]
    protected int m_iSupplyHarborDistributionAmount;

    bool GetSupplyHarborDistributionEnabled() { return m_bSupplyHarborDistributionEnabled; }
    int GetSupplyHarborDistributionAmount() { return m_iSupplyHarborDistributionAmount; }
}
```

## Scenario Design Guidelines

| Base type | Starting supplies | Max cap | Income/tick | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| MOB / HQ | 600 (gamemode default) | 3000 | 40 | Set `m_iSupplies 500` in layer for balance |
| Regular base | 100-500 (randomized) | ~1000 | 4 | |
| Major base | 100-500 | ~1000 | 4 | Often also a supply hub |
| Harbor (T3) |  -  |  -  | 2500/300s | Source only, no income decay |
| Control point | 100-500 | ~1000 | 4 | Lightweight, no supply hub |

**Balance tips from production mods:**
- MOBs at 500 starting (not 3000)  -  forces players to manage supply chains from day 1
- Quick replenish threshold (200) prevents bases from going completely dry during heavy combat
- Relay radios (+4/tick each) reward radio network expansion
- Source bases make harbors strategically important  -  place them at map extremes
